# vanity_calls

## Run the script

`python3 <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/W5ALC/vanity_calls/master/find_calls.py)`

Run the script and it will print the remaining options for 1x2 and 2x1 calls in the US.  If you want to see regions 11-13 as well  (Alaska, Caribbean, Hawaii), call two_by_one() with False instead of True.
