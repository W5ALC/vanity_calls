# vanity_calls

Download l_amat.zip from the FCC here: http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/data/complete/l_amat.zip.  It contains HD.dat.  Point to the correct location of HD.dat in the 'db' variable of the script.  Run the script and it will print the remaining options for 1x2 and 2x1 calls in the US.  If you want to see regions 11-13 as well  (Alaska, Caribbean, Hawaii), call two_by_one() with False instead of True.
